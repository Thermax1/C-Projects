/*****************************************************************
Shell Main Functions
1. Initialize. Read/execute config files. Will change aspects of shell behavior
2. Interpret. Shell reads commands from stdin (interactive or file) and executes the,
3. Terminate. After commands are executed, shell does shutdown commands, free up memory, and terminates

  //Load config files if any
  
  //Run command loop.

/*****************************************************************
Basic Loop Logic for Shell
1. Read. Reads command from standard input
2. Parse. Seperate command string into program and arguments
3. Execute. Run the parsed command

How to Read a line in C. Self-Learning == Success
1. Can be a hassle in C
2. Will never know how much text user enters
3. Start with a block. If exceeded, reallocate with more space
4. This is a common strategy in C, apparently.
*****************************************************************/
#define LSH_RL_BUFSIZE 1024 //Defines macros in a C program. Declares constant values or expression.
char *lsh_read_line(void) {
  
  int bufsize = LSH_RL_BUFSIZE;
  int position = 0;
  char *buffer = malloc(sizeof(char) *bufsize);
  int c;

if(!buffer) { //! reverses meaning of operand. Only works for arithmetic or pointer type
  fprintf(stderr, "lsh: allocation error\n"); //Prints content in file instead of stdout
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}

while(1){
  //Read a character
  c = getchar(); //Stored as int because EOF is an integer and that's how we check for it

  //If we hit EOF, replace with null character and return

  if(c == EOF || c == '\n') {
    buffer[position] = '\0'; //This is a null character or terminator
    return buffer;
  } else {
    buffer[position] = c;
  }
  position++;

  //If we exceed the buffer, we reallocate
  if(position >= bufsize) {

1. For my reference, C has a getline() function in stdio.h that does most of the code above easily. I will demonstrate it now

  if(getline(&line,&bufsize,stdin) == -1){
    if (feof(stdin)){ //feof(function) indicates whether the EOF flag is set for the given stream
      exit(EXIT_SUCCESS); //We got an EOF
    } else {

/*****************************************************************
 How Shells Start Processes
 1. Unix computer boots, kernel loads. Kernel starts ONE process called "Init". Apparently, this almost doesn't count
 2. fork() system call. OS makes duplicate of process and starts them both running. Parent is original, child is new one.
3. fork() returns 0 to child process, and it returns to the parent the PID of its child.
  - Essentially means that the only way for new processes to start is by existing one duplicating itself
  - Sounds like a problem. What if you want to run a new process? You don't want a copy of the same program. There is a solution.
4. exec() system call replaces current running program with an entirely new one. OS stops process, loads up new program, and starts that one in its place.
  - Processes never return from exec() call unless an error happens
5. So we have to have an existing proves fork itself into two separate ones. THEN the child uses exec() to replace itself with a new program.
6. Parents can do other things and even keep tabs on children using wait() system call.
7. Finally, my OS class is starting to make sense
*****************************************************************/

int lsh_launch(char **args) {
  pid_t pid, wpid; //data type that represents process IDs
  int status;

  pid = fork();
  if(pid == 0) {
    // this is the child process
    if(execvp(args[0],args) == -1) { //execvp replaces current process with new process. C program replaced with actual command if successful. Returns -1 otherwise
      perror("lsh");
    }
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

    // This is Error forking

  } else {
    // Parent Process

    do {
      wpid = waitpid(pid, &status, WUNTRACED);
      //waitpid() allows calling thread to obtain status info for one child process. WUNTRACED allows parent to return from wait or waitpid if child stops, exits, or gets killed
    } while(!WIFEXITED(status)&&!WIFSIGNALED(status));
    // WIFEXITED returns True if child terminates normally. WIFSIGNALED returns exit status of child.
